## 🚌 Arrays
Arrays are lists of elements. Basically, arrays use contiguous memory locations to store elements.

### 📌 Characteristics of Arrays
- Arrays are fixed in size. Once declared, their size cannot be changed.
- Elements in an array are stored in contiguous memory locations.
- Arrays can hold multiple values of the same type.
- In JavaScript, arrays are objects and have properties and methods.
- In Rust, all elements in an array must be of the same type.

### 💛 In JavaScript
- JavaScript arrays can hold elements of different types (e.g., numbers, strings, objects).
- Arrays in JavaScript are dynamic, meaning their size can change as elements are added or removed.
- JavaScript provides a rich set of built-in methods for array manipulation (e.g., `push`, `pop`, `map`, `filter`).

```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
numbers.push(6);
console.log(numbers); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```
